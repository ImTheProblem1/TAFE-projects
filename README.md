# TAFE-projects
This is a little repository of all the projects I have done at TAFE during my studies, feel free to use these codes to help with your understanding in the Python language and Scapy module as well.
I am using GitHub as a way to demonstrate what I learnt from TAFE and hoping that you learn a bit from what I learned as well.
